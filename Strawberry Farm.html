    <h5 style="font-style: italic;">Jeanne's Tips</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The best time to visit the strawberry farms in Baguio City is during the peak season, which typically runs from December to May. During this time, the farms are bustling with activity and the strawberries are at their freshest and sweetest.</li>
        <li>Be sure to dress appropriately for the weather and wear comfortable shoes, as some of the farms can be located on hilly terrain.</li>
        <li>There are souvenir shops but I'd recommend buying from the public market instead.</li>
