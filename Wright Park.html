                    <h3>About Wright Park</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
Wright Park is a popular public park located in Baguio City, Philippines. It is named after Governor General Luke E. Wright, who served during the early 1900s when the Philippines was still a U.S. colony.
</p>

<p class="card-text">
The park is known for its wide open spaces, colorful flower gardens, and tall pine trees. It is a popular spot for outdoor activities such as horseback riding, walking, jogging, and picnicking. The park is also home to the Pool of Pines, a man-made lagoon with a small bridge that spans its width.
</p>

<p class="card-text">
One of the highlights of Wright Park is the "Pool of Pines" which is a reflecting pond located at the center of the park. Visitors can rent horses for a ride around the park, or watch a horse show where riders perform various tricks and stunts. There are also several benches and gazebos in the park where visitors can relax and take in the scenery. Wright Park is a great place to escape the busy city and enjoy some fresh air and nature.

    <ul>
        <li>It is open to the public year-round and admission is free. The best time to visit is during the cool months of November to February, when the weather is typically chilly and foggy.</li>
        <li>You can ride a horse around the area or just in the field. If you decide to ride a horse around the area, you will be accompanied by a local.</li>
        <li>There are good souvenir stalls but I'd recommend buying souvenirs in the public market for the best quality and prices.</li>
