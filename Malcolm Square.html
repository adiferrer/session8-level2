    <ul>
        <li>If you're planning to visit Malcolm Square, be sure to check the city's event calendar to see if any special events or activities are taking place. The square is open to the public year-round, and admission is free.</li>
        <li>The public market is across the square, which you can get to through the overpass. As mentioned on my other blog posts, it's better to buy souvenirs in the public market.</li>
