    <ul>
        <li>If you're planning to visit Baguio City and explore Session Road, it's best to come during the cool months of November to February, as the weather is typically chilly and foggy. However, the street can be busy and crowded, so it's important to stay aware of your surroundings and keep your belongings secure.</li>
        <li>Every Sunday, Session Road is closed off. There are several stalls set up on the street. There are also people who busk, draw chalk art on the road and cosplay. Although crowded, it's great to visit during Sundays!</li>
