                    <h3>About Burnham Lake</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
Burnham Lake is one of the top attractions in Baguio City, Philippines. It is located in the center of the city's Burnham Park, which spans over 30 hectares and is a popular spot for picnics, jogging, biking, and other outdoor activities.
</p>

<p class="card-text">
The man-made lake was named after Daniel Burnham, the American architect who planned the city of Baguio. Visitors can rent paddle boats or row boats and explore the lake, enjoying the scenic views of the surrounding gardens and trees. There are also several restaurants and cafes along the lake where visitors can grab a bite to eat while enjoying the view.

<p class="card-text">
In addition to the lake, Burnham Park features a variety of other attractions, including a skating rink, a children's playground, a rose garden, and a athletic oval. The park is also a popular venue for events and festivals throughout the year. 
</p>

<p class="card-text">
Overall, Burnham Lake and Park are must-visit attractions for anyone traveling to Baguio City. They offer a peaceful and scenic escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, and are a great place to relax and unwind.

    <h5 style="font-style: italic;">Jeanne's Tips</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The biking areas can be <em>very</em> crowded so there's a high risk of getting injured (yikes!). If you insist on biking, I'd suggest to not do so during the holidays or weekends.</li>
        <li>Make sure to keep your belongings near you and secured. As a concerned local, I hate when people's experiences are ruined when someone pickpockets them.</li>
        <li>Do not litter. Please. There's appropriate garbage bins.</li>
    </ul>
