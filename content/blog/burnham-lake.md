    <h5 style="font-style: italic;">Jeanne's Tips</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The biking areas can be <em>very</em> crowded so there's a high risk of getting injured (yikes!). If you insist on biking, I'd suggest to not do so during the holidays or weekends.</li>
        <li>Make sure to keep your belongings near you and secured. As a concerned local, I hate when people's experiences are ruined when someone pickpockets them.</li>
        <li>Do not litter. Please. There's appropriate garbage bins.</li>
    </ul>
